This is a small project based on JavaScript in which a series of question will be asked from you to tell you that are you eligible of becoming a spy or not. For this project you will be building a generic website that will seem to ask mundane questions to normal users, but you secretly are looking for a spy! Anyone visiting your website will be asked a series of questions, only the Spy will be able to give specific answers you expect. If all questions are answered correctly, you will post a secret message in console for the Spy to read!

  Here are the four conditions you will check for the spy:
  1.The Spy has the same first letter of her First Name and Last Name.
  2.The Spy is between the Age of 20 and 30 (exclusive of 20 and 30).
  3.The Spy is at least 170 centimeters tall.
  4.The Spy has a pet name that ends with the letter "y".<
